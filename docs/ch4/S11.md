## Overview

This version of the system is a VST plugin that can be used in any DAW that supports VST plugins.

This plugin is built using C++ and JUCE framework, hence it does not require any external software to run.

Althought visually looks different, the system is the same as the Pd/Py version discussed in the [previous pages](../9/).

## Source Code

The source code for the system can be found at [https://github.com/behzadhaki/Groove2DrumVST](https://github.com/behzadhaki/Groove2DrumVST).

In the repository, you can find the detailed instructions on how to install the system.

Despite the later versions of the system, Groove2Drum only is supported on MacOS (Intel) at the moment.

At the first chance I get, I will update the system to be compatible with Windows and Linux as well. 
The porting process is possible (as done in later plugins). However, I have not had the time to do it yet.
