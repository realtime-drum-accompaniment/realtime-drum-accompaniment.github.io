## Jam 1 (Video)

In this video, I am playing a Keith McMillen BopPad and the system is generating a drum accompaniment in real-time.

## Jam 4 (Audio)

In this one, instead of playing the instrumental part, I feed the system a multi-track midi track, and in the mean time 
tweek the parameters of the system. In a sense, I am only controlling the generation process, not what the generations are based on.
