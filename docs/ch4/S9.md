## Overview

<br> 

<img src="/assets/ch4/s9/pypd.png" alt="Alt text" width="800"/>

<br> 

This version of the system consists of a Pure Data frontend and a Python backend. 

The frontend takes care of MIDI handling, visualization and interaction with the model.

On the other hand, the backend is responsible for running the model and sending the output back to the frontend.

There is a self-contained VST version of the system as well that can be accessed [here](../supplementary/11/).
