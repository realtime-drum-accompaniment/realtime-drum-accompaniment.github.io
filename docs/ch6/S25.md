### Eurorack Jams

Setup: 

For the GrooveTransformer’s input groove, it receives a multiple of the Intellijel Metropolix gate and pitch sequence that controls the Acid Technology Chainsaw voice in the Eurorack. 
In this scenario, we have opted to use the pitch values of each note event to represent the velocity of the input. 
The pitch and gate voltages are sent from the Eurorack to the GrooveTransformer via an Expert Sleepers ES-9 DC-coupled audio interface and a Cardinal CV to MIDI converter plug-in.
Generated drum patterns from the GrooveTransformer are converted to Control Voltage (CV) and sent to the Eurorack via a PolyEnd Poly2 MIDI to CV converter.

Drum Synthesis:

We use 7 voices of the generated patterns (kick, snare, open and closed hi-hat, and lo/mid/hi tom) to trigger 4 voices in the Eurorack:  
Kick: Schlappi Engineering Angle Grinder + Make Noise Moddemix VCA + Intellijel Quadrax envelope generator
Snare: Intellijel Plonk
Open and Closed Hi-Hats: Basimilus Iteritas Alter
Lo, Mid, Hi Toms: Akemie’s Taiko

To retain generated dynamics, the kick, hi-hats, and toms are routed to individual channels on a Mutable Instruments Veils.  The level of each channel is controlled with the velocity sequence associated with the corresponding voice	
The Intellijel Plonk has a dedicated velocity input that we utilized rather than routing the signal to Veils
